This project is a simple interactive quiz game that runs entirely in the browser console, without requiring any HTML or DOM manipulation.
It reinforces core JavaScript concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, functions, and user input/output.


## Working :

*A predefined list of questions and answers is stored inside an array.
*The program loops through each question using a for loop.
*For every question:
a)The user is prompted using prompt()
b)Their response is processed using .trim().toLowerCase() to allow flexible input
c)Immediate feedback is given through alert() — correct or incorrect
d)The user's score increases with every correct answer.
e)After all questions are answered, the final score is displayed.

## How to run :
*How to Run the Game
*Open any web browser (Chrome recommended)
*Right-click → Inspect → open the Console tab
*Copy & paste the JavaScript quiz code into the console
*Press Enter to start playing
*You will automatically receive prompts with quiz questions.
